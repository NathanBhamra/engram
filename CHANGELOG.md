# Changelog

All notable changes to Engram will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **`engram forget <id>` command** — single-node curation primitive.
  Deletes one node by ID, cascades edges, removes the on-disk note, and
  audit-logs the action as `op=node_forget` with the title, tags, and
  optional `--reason`. Supports `--dry-run` for preview and `--yes` to
  skip the confirmation prompt. Fills the gap between "do nothing" and
  the nuclear `engram rebuild` for when a single node is wrong (operator
  paste error, mis-attributed ticket, polluting smoke-test artefact).
  4 new integration tests.

### Changed

- **SKILL.md (`engram-memory`)** — new **"One fact per call"** rule,
  prominently placed in the storage section. The chunker does not detect
  topic boundaries inside a paragraph; agents must split unrelated facts
  into separate `autostore` calls or risk poisoning future recall. Adds
  a `forget` section under "Verifying & curating".

### Notes

- **Trigger** — v0.5.0 dogfooding surfaced one polluting node where an
  Engram release fact was glued to an unrelated Jira ticket reference in
  a single smoke-test paste. The chunker behaved correctly (one
  paragraph → one chunk) but the input violated the implicit one-idea
  contract. The fix is discipline at the call site plus the `forget`
  primitive to recover when discipline slips — *not* a heuristic
  topic-segmenter in the chunker (rejected as brittle).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **`engram autostore` command** — the per-turn auto-store hook. Pipes
  content through the worthiness filter, audit-logs the decision, stores
  if worthy, and **always exits 0** so wrapper scripts and agent loops can
  pipe through unconditionally. Quiet by default; `--verbose` or `--json`
  surface the verdict. Eliminates the manual `engram store ...` ceremony
  that was the friction point preventing real dogfooding.
- **Reject-side audit logging** — `audit_log` now also records every
  `store_reject` with the full signal breakdown (`signals`, `word_count`,
  `reason`, `tags`, `node_type`). This is the data Week 2 will use to tune
  `min_signals` / `min_word_count`.
- **`engram audit --pretty`** — human-readable output for weekly review;
  one line per entry with verdict, signal kinds, tags, and title plus an
  indented reason. `--json` emits one parseable object per line for scripted
  analysis.
- **`engram-autostore.cmd` / `.ps1` wrappers** in `~/.copilot/bin/` so any
  shell or agent can pipe through `engram-autostore <flags>` without
  knowing the venv path.

### Changed

- **`store_log` payload schema** — both successful stores and rejections
  now include `title`, `reason`, `signals`, `word_count`, `tags`, and
  `node_type`. The successful-store entry additionally carries `id`,
  `redactions`, and `forced`. Existing consumers that read only `id` /
  `session` continue to work.
- **SKILL.md (`engram-memory`)** — rewritten to make `autostore` the
  default storage call for agents; manual `engram store` reserved for
  interactive debug. Adds a weekly-review section pointing at the new
  `audit --pretty` and `engram usage` flow.

### Notes

- **Week 2 of the auto-store rollout** is the next milestone: review one
  week of `audit_log` entries with `engram audit --op store_reject --pretty`,
  tune the worthiness signals, ship as 0.5.1 or 0.6.0 depending on scope.
- **No CLI hook into Copilot session lifecycle yet** — agents call
  `autostore` themselves per the SKILL. A native hook would supersede this
  if/when the CLI exposes one.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **`engram usage` command** — reports nodes/edges, type breakdown, DB size,
  estimated tokens stored (~4 chars/token heuristic), and notional cost to
  re-derive the corpus body from chat at configurable per-million pricing.
  Supports `--json` for scripted consumption and `--input-price` /
  `--output-price` overrides so the figures stay accurate as model pricing
  changes. Makes the value of dogfooding Engram quantitatively visible.

### Fixed

- **Viewer version drift** — `viz.html` / `viz-3d.html` are static snapshots
  whose embedded version stamp only updates when `engram view` is re-run.
  Documented that re-rendering is part of the release flow; both rendered
  artifacts are now refreshed alongside any version bump. (No code change
  required — discipline + release-checklist update.)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **3D viewer** — new `engram view --3d` flag renders a WebGL knowledge graph
  to `viz-3d.html` using `3d-force-graph` + Three.js with `UnrealBloomPass`
  bloom, optional edge particles, and orbit / fit / reset camera presets.
- **Auto-named clusters** — clusters are now labelled from their most
  distinctive tags using a TF-IDF-style score (`tf × log((N+1)/(1+df))`),
  with a title-keyword fallback when a cluster has no tags. Names appear in
  cluster filter chips, the colour legend, the hover tooltip, and the
  selection info card across both viewers. `metrics.cluster_labels()` is
  the new public helper; `cluster_counts()` now returns a `label` field.
- **Cross-viewer mode pill** — the brand row in each viewer shows a single
  pill that switches to the other mode (2D ↔ 3D); the 3D viewer also
  carries a pulsing **BETA** badge so it's clear the WebGL viewer is WIP.
- **Shared design language** — the 3D viewer's sidebar, panels, filter
  sections, watermark, version footer, and chip styling now match the
  2D viewer pixel for pixel; both viewers share the same CSS variables,
  glassmorphism skin, collapsible sections, and stats-grid layout.
- **Three-pinned-version policy** — `static-3d.html.jinja` pins
  `three@0.184.0` in its importmap to match what `3d-force-graph@1.73.4`
  bundles, preventing `UnrealBloomPass` from blowing up on version drift.

### Changed

- **Public-repo scrub** — README example, plugin manifest, skill, agent
  doc, and test fixtures rewritten to remove all internal/company strings
  (project keys, runner names, internal tooling) so the public repo reads
  as a generic open-source project.
- **Sidebar stats** — the 3D viewer's stats grid moved out of a
  collapsible section and now sits at the top of the sidebar to match
  the 2D viewer.

### Notes

- 61/61 tests passing.
- No new runtime dependencies (3D viewer is CDN-only at runtime).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: `pyproject.toml`, `src/` layout, `mkdocs-material` docs skeleton.
- Initial SQLite schema (`001_initial.sql`) with versioned migrations.
- CLI skeleton with `--version` and registered subcommand placeholders.
- Bootstrap script (`scripts/bootstrap.ps1`) and check script (`scripts/check.ps1`).
- MIT licence, README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE.
- **Phase 1 MVP CLI** — `store`, `recall`, `verify`, `list-stale`, `audit`,
  `rebuild`, `doctor` commands fully wired end-to-end.
- **Core modules**: `redaction` (8 built-in patterns, fail-closed),
  `worthiness` (8 signal types + `!store` force), `chunker` (header-aware,
  code-fence-atomic), `notes` (markdown-on-disk frontmatter I/O),
  `aliases` (bidirectional query expansion), `storage` (orchestrator).
- **Recall pipeline**: `fts` (FTS5 BM25 with alias expansion) +
  `ranking` (past-TTL demotion, token-budget selection, stale banners).
- **Tests**: 46 unit + integration tests covering redaction, worthiness,
  chunker (incl. code-fence atomicity), aliases, FTS query construction,
  ranking, and an end-to-end store→recall round trip.
- **Phase 2 MVP Viewer** — `engram view` command renders a self-contained
  HTML knowledge graph using vis-network.
- **Viz modules**: `edges` (shared-tag jaccard ≥ 0.05, co-recall count ≥ 2,
  `[[wiki-link]]` extraction, manual edges preserved), `metrics` (NetworkX
  degree / Louvain communities / PageRank, written back to `nodes` table),
  `theme` (dark + light palettes, degree-and-pagerank node sizing),
  `exporter` (SQLite → vis-network JSON with stale colour overlay and
  per-edge-type width scaling), `renderer` (Jinja2 + vendored
  `vis-network.min.js`, CDN fallback).
- **Viewer UI**: sidebar with graph stats, legend, search and selection
  detail panel; barnesHut physics tuned for readability; dark theme default.
- **Vendored asset**: `vis-network 9.1.9` (672 KB) shipped inline so the
  generated HTML is fully offline-capable.
- **Tests**: +15 new Phase 2 tests (edges derivation, metrics recompute,
  exporter shape + quarantine filter, renderer HTML emission, CDN
  fallback). Total now 61 passing.
- **scipy** added to dependencies (required by NetworkX's PageRank).
